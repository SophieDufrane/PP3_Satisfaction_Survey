# Moodtracker - Keep a continuous pulse on your people.

The [Moodtracker](https://satisfaction-survey-sd-a479e4d4f1cf.herokuapp.com/) project was inspired by a tool already in use at *Workhuman*, the company I work for. This tool is designed to gauge employee satisfaction and provide valuable insights through survey data analysis.

This Python project is a simplified version of the *Workhuman - Moodtracker*. It provides a command-line program that serves two distinct purposes:
- To allow employees to easily participate in a satisfaction survey.
- To enable Human Ressources or management to analyse the survey data, generate key insights and identify areas for improvement.

**For Employees (Survey Respondents)**:
- As an employee, I want to easily access and complete the survey questions so that I can share my feedback on the companyâ€™s performance, culture and how I feel in my current role.

- As an employee, I want the survey process to be simple and straightforward so that I can complete it quickly without technical difficulties.

**For Human Ressources & Managers (Survey Analysis)**:
- As an HR manager, I want to collect and analyse employee responses so that I can identify trends, review the overall sentiment and identify areas of concern within the company.

- As a manager, I want to generate summary statistics and analyse top satisfaction and top concerns so I can make data-driven decisions to improve employee satisfaction.

## Features:

To define the structure of the program, I started by working with a flowchart on [Lucid](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/6696772b-e3ff-4ca0-9902-c664edc9038e/edit?invitationId=inv_e35a23e0-a2a0-4a1a-8bd6-4be77803b441&page=0_0#). The flowchart helped me visualize the overall flow of the application, including how users interact with the main menu, survey questions, and analysis options. It helped defining the logical steps from displaying the menu, collecting user input, and storing survey responses, to analyzing the data retrieved from a Google Sheets.

By using a flowchart, I wanted to ensure a smooth, logical flow of data throughout.

### Existing Features:

**Main Menu**

- *Overview*: The Main Menu serves as a starting point for navigating the program.

- *Features*:
  - **Clear Option Presentation**: The menu presents the available options in a simple, easy-to-read format.
    - Menu Handlin: Menu options are managed using a `MenuOptions` class. This allows for flexibility, as the same code is used for different menus. A `for` loop is used to iterate over the list of options and display them, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
  - **Input Validation**: User inputs are validated to ensure that only valid options are accepted. If an invalid option is entered, the user is prompted to try again.
  - **User Flow**: The program allows users to easily navigate between sections.

**Moodtracker Survey**

- *Goal*: To collect employee satisfaction levels. This tool offers a simple and engaging way for employees to provide feedback regurlarly, on different aspects of the work environment.

- *Features*:
  - **Question Display**: The survey presents one question at a time, allowing employees to provide thoughtful responses.
    - Survey Logic: The survey uses dictionaries to store questions and possible answers. Each question is a 'key,' and the possible answers are the 'values.' This structure made it easy to add more questions later (which I did after working with a shorter sample to test the function).
  - **Input Validation**: The program ensures that all inputs are valid.
    - Validation Logic: Input validation is managed using a `while` loop and `try-except` block. The `try` block checks if the input is a valid integer within the expected range. If not, an exception is raised, and the user is prompted to enter a correct value.
  - **Summary**: Displays user responses at the end of the survey, providing a clear overview of what will be recorded.
  - **Next Action**: After the survey, users can return to the main menu or exit the program.

- *User Experience*: The survey design is quite simple and user-friendly, guiding employees through the process seamlessly. Prompts and clear instructions make it easy for users to navigate and complete the survey.

**Analysis Program**

- *Goal*: To provide insightful data analysis from a large panel of employee responses to Human Ressources and managers.

- *Feature*: 
  - **Interactive Menu**: The analysis section offers a easy-to-navigate menu with multiple options to explore survey results in detail.
  - **Input Validation**: Similar to the survey section, user inputs are validated.
  - **Summary Analysis**: Provides an overview of survey responses.
    - Responses are counted and stored in a dictionary. These counts are converted into percentages by dividing by the total number of responses, giving a clear picture of how employees feel.
  - **Top Satisfaction and Top Concerns**: Shows the most and least favorable areas.
    - Sorting Logic: The analysis program uses lambda functions to sort questions by satisfaction scores (e.g., "Very Satisfied" = 5 points).
  - **Next Action**: After analysis, users can return to the main menu or exit.

- *User Experience*: This section has been designed to give HR professionals and managers quick access to meaningful statistics, making decision-making more informed and efficient.

### Features left to implement:

**Credentials requirement to access to Analysis Program**
- Since the analysis section contains confidential survey results, a credential check will be implemented to ensure only authorized personnel can access this data.

**Additional Analysis Options**
- The analysis program will be expanded to include more detailed metrics and deeper insights, providing a more comprehensive view of employee satisfaction and potential areas for improvement.

## Manual Testing:

During development, I used [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) to break down and visualize small blocks of code. This tool allowed me to test the execution of the program, catching issues and confirming when the logic worked as expected.

***Key Tests, Bugs and fixs:***

- **API and Google Sheets Integration**
  - *Expected*: The program retrieves data from the survey_result worksheet.
  - *Testing*: Added a print() statement to display the retrieved data, then ran run.py in the terminal.
  - *Result*: The data was retrieved from the correct worksheet and displayed in the terminal without errors.

- **Main Menu Input Validation**
  - *Expected*: The program only accepts valid inputs (1, 2, or 3) and provide access to the choosen section. Invalid inputs should trigger an error message prompting the user to try again.
  - *Testing*: Ran run.py in the terminal, testing valid and invalid inputs.
  - *Result*: The program correctly processed valid inputs, allowing access to the selected section. Invalid inputs displayed the error message.

- **Main Menu Display with Class and Dictionary**
  - *Expected*: The menu options display in correct order (1, 2, 3) along with their respective section names.
  - *Testing*: Added a print() statement to display the set used for storing menu options then ran run.py in the terminal.
  - *Result*: The options were displayed in reverse order (3 to 1).
  - *Fix*: To maintain the correct order, I replaced the set used for storing menu options with a dictionary, which preserves the insertion order.

- **Survey Display**
  - *Expected*: The program displays questions one at a time, allowing user to select their answers before moving to the next question.
  - *Testing*: Ran run.py in the terminal to simulate the survey.
  - *Result*: All questions were displayed simultaneously.
  - *Fix*: The input for user answers was placed outside the loop, causing all questions to appear at once. I moved the input inside the loop so the program waited for user input before moving to the next question.

- **Survey responses**
  - *Expected*: User responses to be collected and displayed in a summary.
  - *Testing*: Ran run.py and submitted answers to test the response collection.
  - *Result*: Incorrect responses were displayed (e.g., "Satisfied" instead of "Very Satisfied").
  - *Fix*: The issue came from the indexing in the list of answers (zero-based). By subtracting 1 from user choice, I ensured the correct answer was selected. Additionally, I noticed a variable name conflict in the final print loop (`answers` was reused), so I renamed it to `selected_answer` to clarify.

- **Analysis Menu**
  - *Expected*: Displays analysis options in the correct order (1, 2, 3).
  - *Testing*: Ran run.py and checked the order of the menu display.
  - *Result*: The menu options were displayed in reverse (3 to 1).
  - *Fix*: Similar to the main menu, I switched to using a dictionary to preserve the correct order. I also corrected an issue by passing the correct variable `analysis_menu` to the `get_user_choice` function instead of `main_menu`.


## Refactoring Process: Improving Efficiency and Readability

- **Menu Handling Logic**
  - *Before Refactoring*: Initially, I had separate functions for handling different parts of the program. Each had its own logic to display options and get user input, which was repetitive.

  - *After Refactoring*: I created a more generic `MenuOptions` class that could be reused for all menus. With this in place, I only need to define the options and could reuse the same functions for handling the display across multiple menus, reducing duplication.

- **Avoiding repetitions**
  - *Before Refactoring*: Despite the `MenuOptions` class, I noticed that I was still repeating similar blocks of code to display Menu titles and options. For example, the Main menu and Analysis menu had nearly identical code for introducing the section.

![BeforeRefactoring](media/analysis_menu_before_refactoring.webp)

  - *After Refactoring*: I created two generic functions to separately handle the display of the title and the display of the options for each Menu. Next, I applied the same approach to how each function handled user input and called the next action. These functions are now reusable across different sections independently.

### PEP8 validation

I used *flake8* to test the conformity of the file `run.py` according to PEP8 standards. Below are the steps I followed:
- To install the linter in *Gitpod*, I ran the following command in the terminal:
  - `pip install flake8`
- To run the linter on run.py, I used:
  - `flake8 run.py`.

Here the list of main issues raised and fixed after running flake8:
  - E302: Expected 2 blank lines, found 1
  - W293: Blank line contains whitespace
  - E231: Missing whitespace around operator
  - E501: Line too long (### > 79 characters)

Using flake8 first was beneficial because it allowed me to understand the specific formatting issues and learn the rules of PEP 8. After a few rounds of manual corrections, I found that switching to an automated tool like *Black* improved efficiency. Below are the steps I followed: 
- To install black for automatic code formatting:
  - `pip install black`
- To format the code using black on the specific file:
  - `black run.py`

### Inspiration

The idea for this project was inspired by [Workhuman](https://www.workhuman.com/), a company that offers solutions to improve employee engagement and feedback mechanisms. 

### External Libraries

- `gspread`: Used to interact with *Google Sheets*. This library was essential for retrieving and storing survey responses in real-time, allowing the application to dynamically update and analyze survey data directly from the Google Sheets document.
- `google.oauth2`: Used for authenticating access to *Google Sheets* via service account credentials. This library was crucial for secure and authorized access to the Google Sheets API, ensuring that only authorized users can read or write data to the survey spreadsheet.

### Resources

- [Love Sandwiches Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-sandwiches-p5-sourcecode/tree/master/05-deployment/01-deployment-part-1): 
  - This *Code Institute* project provided guidance on how to implement the integration with *Google Sheets*. Specifically, the setup for `gspread` and Credentials authentication was adapted from this project.
  - For example, the code handling *Google Sheets* authentication and updating (in the `update_worksheet` and `get_survey_data` functions) was based on *Love Sandwiches* but modified to suit the needs of this Moodtracker project. These modifications included adjusting for different worksheet names and data formatting for survey responses. 
  - The validation logic using a `while True` loop with `try-except` for user input was also adapted from the *Love Sandwiches* project. This logic was reused and slightly modified to handle different menu options and return selections based on this project's requirements.
- [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit): 
  - This online tool was used to visualize and debug blocks of Python code, helping to ensure the logic was correct throughout development.
- [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/): 
  - These resources were used for code formatting and validation according to Python standards. Flake8 was initially used for style error detection, while Black was employed for automated code formatting.
